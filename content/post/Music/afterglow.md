I am heading for sunset

Sunset is near me

Rivulet is running sparkle

Boat on rivulet, down and then gone

Leave me here, by the whirlpool



Whirlpool is waving

With gentle smiling eyes

I can stare the eyes

Where I can stay for a drink



Drink is fine

With bubbling fishes

Am I their friends?

I may go now



They urge me to stay

I don’t know how to be pitiless

Because I am cold

I need the afterglow



That’s fine

I can repose for a long time

They are cheerful

But they are cold
